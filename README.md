# Citi-Bike-Analysis

## Background

Since 2013, the Citi Bike Program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Each month bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the Citi Bike Data webpage(https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data). My task on the job was to build a set of data reports to visulize bike utilization and popular stations. 

## Data Analysis

The citi bike data I used was from March 2016. I used Tableau to create ten different charts. According to the ten charts, I figured out the following questions. 

1. The top ten popular start and end stations are:
